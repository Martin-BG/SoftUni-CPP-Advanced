===== 01. Which of the following is not a valid C++ construct (i.e. valid things in C++)?

- . `int* p` - a pointer to a pointer to an `integer`
- . `int*** p` - a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an `integer`
- . `int& p` - a reference to an `integer`
- , `int&&& p` - a reference to a reference to a reference to an `integer`

===== 02. Are there any bugs in this piece of code?

[source,cpp]
----
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        ptr = new int;
        *ptr = i;
    }
----

- . There will be a compilation error
- . There are no bugs in this program
- , There are memory leaks
- . There will be an out-of-bound exception

===== 03. Will the following piece of code execute and what will happen (assume the `Table` class is defined and has a default ctor)?

[source,cpp]
----
    std::unique_ptr<Table> tableOne(new Table());
    std::unique_ptr<Table> tableTwo = tableOne;
----

- . This code has not bugs and the program will execute cleanly.
- , There will be a compile time error.
- . Behavior is undefined
- . There will be a runtine error - unique_ptr could not hold a user defined type.

===== 04. What will the following code do?

[source,cpp]
----
    std::string& operator<<(std::string& a, std::string& b) {
      a.append(b);
    }

    int main() {
      std::string a = "piece";
      std::string b = "Of";
      std::string c = "Cake";

      a << b << c;
      std::cout << a << std::endl;

      return 0;
    }
----

- , Behavior is undefined
- . Print "pieceOfCake"
- . Print "piece Of Cake"
- . Cause a compilation error

===== 05. Which of the following initializes an object of the class below, with the value field assigned to 0?

[source,cpp]
----
    template<typename T>
    struct Container {
      Container() : value() {}
      T value;
    };
----

- . `Container obj<int>();`
- . `Container obj<int>;`
- , `Container<int> obj;`
- . `Container obj(0);`

===== 06. Does the following code have potential memory leaks?

[source,cpp]
----
    class Info {
      int size;
      vector<int> data;
    public:
      Info(int size) : size(size) {}
      ~Info() {
        data.clear();
      }
    };
----

- . Behavior is undefined
- . Yes
- , No
- . No, but there will be runtime error in the destructor

===== 07. What will the following code print (assuming all necessary code is included and all necessary namespaces are used)?

[source,cpp]
----
    class Base {
    public:
      virtual ~Base() = default;
        virtual void print() { std::cout << "Base"; }
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        virtual void print() { std::cout << "Derived"; }
    };

    int main() {
        Base* p = new Derived();
        p->print();
        delete p;
        return 0;
    }
----

- . Nothing, the code will not compile
- . "Base"
- , "Derived"
- . Nothing, there will be a runtime error

===== 08. Can a class have more than one base class?

- . No
- , Yes
- . Yes, but all base classes must have implemented destructors
- . Yes, but all except 1 base classes must have implemented destructors
