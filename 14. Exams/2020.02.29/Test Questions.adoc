===== 01. What will be the output to the console If we have:

[source,cpp]
----
    int arr[]{ 13, 42, 69 };
    int* p = &arr[1];
    ++(*p);

    for (const int elem : arr) {
        std::cout << elem << ' ';
    }
----

- . 14 43 70
- , 13 43 69
- . 13 43 70
- . 13 42 69

===== 02. What will happen if we call delete two times in a row on a dynamically allocated integer?

- , Behavior is undefined
- . there would be a memory leak
- . the memory will get freed only if the Operating System (OS) allows to
- . there will be a compilation error

===== 03. Will the following piece of code execute and what will happen (assume the Building class is defined and has a default ctor)?

[source,cpp]
----
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        std::unique_ptr<Building> buildingOne(new Building());
        std::unique_ptr<Building> buildingTwo(new Building());
    }
----

- = This code has not bugs and the program will execute cleanly.
- . There is a compilation error.
- . There is a memory leak.
- . There is a runtime error - you cannot use std::unique_ptr inside a loop

===== 04. What will the following code do?

[source,cpp]
----
    std::string& operator<<(std::string& a, std::string& b) {
        a.append(b);
        return a;
    }

    int main() {
        std::string a = "this";
        std::string b = "Looks";
        std::string c = "Familiar";

        a << b << c;
        std::cout << a << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }
----

- . Behavior is undefined
- , Print "thisLooksFamiliar"
- . Print "this Looks Familiar"
- . Cause a compilation error

===== 05. Given the code below, what is the correct way to call the function `multiply` so that it returns a `float` result?

[source,cpp]
----
    template<typename T>
    T multiply(T a, T b) {
        return a / b;
    }
----

- . multiply<float, int>(1, 2)
- , multiply<float>(1, 2)
- . multiply<float, int, int>(1, 2)
- . multiply(1, 2)

===== 06. Which of the following prevents creating copies of the <code>Dog</code> class, if placed inside it?

- . Dog(const Dog& other) = default; Dog& operator=(const Dog& other) = default;
- , Dog(const Dog& other) = delete; Dog& operator=(const Dog& other) = delete;
- . Dog(const Dog& other) = delete;
- . Dog& operator=(const Dog& other) = delete;

===== 07. What will the following code print (assuming all necessary code is included)?

[source,cpp]
----
    class Base {
    public:
        void print() { std::cout << "Base"; }
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        void print() { std::cout << "Derived"; }
    };

    int main() {
        Base* p = new Derived();
        p->print();
        delete p;
        return 0;
    }
----

- . Nothing, the code will not compile
- , "Base"
- . "Derived"
- . Nothing, there will be a runtime error

===== 08. If a class has a pure-virtual method, it:

- . can be instantiated
- . cannot have a virtual destructor
- . cannot have a copy constructor
- , can be inherited
